# Endless_Runner_Unity_Mobile
A 2D Endless Runner Mobile game created in Unity 1.8.2 . (Not To Publish)

The aim of this project is simply understand Unity 2d Better as well as the Unity Interface.

As this is was one of my first projects on unity it was used with a lot of trial and error approaches.

In this, The Tile editor, Box colliders, method groups and navigation methods were used and tested. Allowing me to learn all the necessary tools in player and camera movement scripting, basic 2D level design as well as randomized object generation and spooling.
